# pxt-finch
A library for the Finch robot in MakeCode

```
finch.startFinch()
basic.forever(function () {
    finch.setBeak(0, 0, 100)
    basic.pause(100)
    finch.setBeak(0, 42, 0)
    basic.pause(100)
})
```
# Reference
## Start Finch
This block is required for every Finch program
``` 
finch.startFinch()
```

## Finch Beak
Sets the tri-color LED in the finch's beak to color specified by red, green, and blue brightness values. The values range from 0% to 100%.
``` 
finch.setBeak(85, 0, 100)
```

## Finch Tail
Sets one or all of the tri-color LEDs in the Finch tail to the color specified by red, green, and blue brightness values. The values range from 0% to 100%.
``` 
finch.setTail(TailPort.All, 0, 100, 0)
```

## Finch Move
Moves the Finch forward or back for a given distance at a given speed (0-100%).
``` 
finch.setMove(MoveDir.Forward, 50, 50)
```

## Finch Turn
Turns the Finch right or left a given angle at a given speed (0-100%).
``` 
finch.setTurn(RLDir.Right, 45, 50)
```

## Finch Wheels
Sets the rotation speeds of the left and right Finch wheels to values from -100 to 100%.
``` 
finch.startMotors(50, 50)
```

## Finch Stop
Stops the Finch wheels.
``` 
finch.stopMotors()
```

## Finch Distance
Returns the value of the Finch distance sensor in cm.
``` 
finch.getDistance()
```

## Finch Light
Returns the value of the right or left Finch light sensor from 0 to 100.
``` 
finch.getLight(RLDir.Right)
```

## Finch Line
Returns the value of the right or left Finch line tracking sensor from 0 to 100.
``` 
finch.getLine(RLDir.Right)
```

## Finch Reset Encoders
Sets the value of the left and right encoders to zero.
``` 
finch.resetEncoders
```

## Finch Encoder
Returns the number of rotations that the right or left wheel has turned.
``` 
finch.getEncoder(RLDir.Right)
```

## Finch Beak Up/Beak Down/Etc.
Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether or not the Finch is in the selected position.
``` 
finch.getFinchOrientation(Orientation.BeakUp)
```

## Finch Compass
Returns the value of the Finch compass in degrees.
``` 
finch.getFinchCompass()
```

## Finch Accelerometer/Magentometer
Returns the value of the Finch accelerometer or magnetometer in the * x, y, or z direction.
``` 
finch.getFinchAM(AorM.Accelerometer, Dimension.X)
```

## Finch Battery
Reads the value of the battery in milliVolts. You may start to see strange behavior when the value is below 3373 mV.
``` 
finch.getBattery()
```
